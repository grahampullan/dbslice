This is a branch of the original dbslice project (https://github.com/grahampullan/dbslice).

Interactive axes have now been introduced on some plot types.


Known bugs and missing desired behaviour:
- Loading and saving the data used and filters applied to the session file




Getting the minimal working example going:
- Download the repository
- Initialise a local server in the repository folder. E.g. Install the 'http-server' package from 'npm' locally in this folder, or install it globally, and then initialise the server by 'http-server -p 1234'. 
- Open a browser, and type 'localhost/examples/comp3row/index.html' into the address bar, and the example should appear.
